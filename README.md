## DELIVERABLES

  ### I need an Elementor widget that plays a MP4 video on scroll, and letting me control these properties:
  ##### ○ Choose the video file from the library
  ##### ○ Choose the range of the page to play the video (for example: in 14% of the length of the page start the video, and end it on the 84% of the page length) - like the Lottie widget already does, see attachment.
  ##### ○ Control the width \ height of the video.
  ##### ○ Include the regular "Advanced" widget tab in Elementor.

      The idea is to make things like that:

  ### FAQ
      1. Elementor plugin itself? it cannot be done by the external plugin? 
         I will need to install it on several websites, and I fear updates will ruin the code if it will be in the main elementor plugin

      2. Another thing please - 
         all the values had to be edit responsively too, with the little Elementor icon that lets you choose different values for different breakpoints.
